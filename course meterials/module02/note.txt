if we didnot provide the variable default name, we can provide at the terminal 
fo example:
terraform plan -var=”rgname=rg-tn-var-01” -var=”saname=satn123456tn”

or 

just write terraform plan: and it will ask the value for rg name

the problem is that, we have to rewrite the saname when we make terraform apply: enter a value for saname 

we can deploy with the following commands: 
terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan -out="main.tfplan"
terraform apply "main.tfplan"
